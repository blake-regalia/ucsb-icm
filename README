GIT:

To make git easier you can add aliases to the command line interface.

Assuming you have git installed, open a terminal and run the following commands:
cd ~/
pwd

This will tell you what directory the .gitconfig file is in, navigate there and open .gitconfig file. Append the following to your .gitconfig file:
[alias]
	unstage = reset HEAD
	cap = "!f(){ git commit -m \"$*\" && git push -u origin sandbox; }; f"
	ass = !git add * && git status -s
	
	
Save and close. Now you can do the following:

git ass    <-- adds all modified files to the staging area and lists their status

git cap this is my commit message <-- commits the staging area to the repo, with the message 'this is my commit message', then pushes the repo to origin master (our master repo hosted on github)
